# Browser Extensions for TunePlay

The official browser extension for TunePlay is available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera!

## Download

[Google Chrome version](https://github.com/FreekBes/tuneplay-extensions/archive/master.zip)

[Mozilla Firefox version](https://www.tuneplay.net/downloads/tuneplay-for-firefox.xpi)

[Opera version](https://www.tuneplay.net/downloads/tuneplay-for-opera.nex)

## Installation

### Google Chrome
1. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file, then open Google Chrome.
2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (via omnibox or menu > Tools > Extensions).
3. Enable developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
4. Click on the "Load unpacked extension" button.
5. Navigate to the directory of the unpacked ZIP file and select the directory `chrome`. Then press OK.

> Currently, all Windows users will always see an information bubble with "Disable developer mode extensions" when they start Chrome or open a new incognito window, which is really annoying. The only way for Windows users to use unpacked extensions without such dialogs is to switch to Chrome on the developer channel, by installing [the developer version of Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/index.html?extra=devchannel#eula).

### Firefox
1. Click on the download link above in Firefox.
2. In the dialog, press 'Allow' or 'Trust' or anything like this. Then choose 'Install'.

### Opera
1. Navigate to the downloaded `.nex`-file in the File Explorer.
2. Open the file by double clicking, then press "Install".
