# Browser Extensions for TunePlay

The official browser extension for TunePlay is available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Opera!

## Functionality

Using this extension, you can easily add tracks from YouTube, Soundcloud and Mixcloud. Do so by opening the track you want to add on the corresponding website, start playing it, then click the extension button up top and select 'Add a track to TunePlay'. Follow the instructions on screen. *Please do not forget to add the correct artists as well when the TunePlay Editor gets opened*!

You can also search for stuff on TunePlay more easily. Just start typing `TunePlay` in the address bar, followed by what you'd like to search for! Your browser will then automatically search on TunePlay instead of using Google. Select the result you want using the arrow buttons or your mouse.


## Download & installation

### Google Chrome
1. [Download this repository](https://github.com/FreekBes/tuneplay-extensions/archive/master.zip).
2. Unzip the downloaded ZIP file, then open Google Chrome.
3. Navigate to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) (via omnibox or menu > Tools > Extensions).
4. Enable developer mode by ticking the checkbox in the upper-right corner.
5. Click on the "Load unpacked extension" button.
6. Navigate to the directory of the unpacked ZIP file and select the directory `chrome`. Then press OK.

> Currently, all Windows users will always see an information bubble with "Disable developer mode extensions" when they start Chrome or open a new incognito window, which is really annoying. The only way for Windows users to use unpacked extensions without such dialogs is to switch to Chrome on the developer channel, by installing [the developer version of Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/index.html?extra=devchannel#eula).

### Mozilla Firefox
1. Click [here](https://www.tuneplay.net/downloads/tuneplay-for-firefox.xpi) to start the installation directly from Firefox itself.
2. In the dialog, press 'Allow' or 'Trust' or anything like this. Then choose 'Install'.

### Opera
1. Download the installer [here](https://www.tuneplay.net/downloads/tuneplay-for-opera.nex).
2. Open the `.nex` file using the download history or your File Explorer.
3. When Opera opens, click on the button 'Go to extensions' (in the banner up top). If Opera does not open automatically, open Opera, then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd>.
4. Press the 'Install' button next to TunePlay (and then choose 'Yes, install').


## Updating the extension

### Google Chrome & Opera
When an update is available, the extension will notify you when you open it. A button will appear up top, letting you know an update is available. Upon clicking this button, the update will then start downloading. Please wait for this to finish (this should not take too long). When the download is finished, the download button will turn into an 'Install' button. Press this button to install the update.

### Mozilla Firefox
The Firefox version of TunePlay will install updates automatically!
